# Big O - 
>way of **comparing two piece of code** in a way that we could know how efficient a code was

**Time Complexity:** - about time
**Space Complexity :** - about memory space

>**Omaega**(best case scenario) , **Theta**(avg case scenario) , **Omegron**(worst case scenario)

>Big O(n):  Eg: - 
def print_itmes(n):
    for i in range(n):
        print(i)
print_itmes(10)
it gonna return 0...9 
it is the example of O(n) cuz we pass the no (n), and it ran n times or n operations,

On a graph
it always gonnna be a straight line or a propotional line,
